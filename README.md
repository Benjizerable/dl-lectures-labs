### Lab and Home Assignment Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks for the labs can be found in the `labs` folder of
the [github repository](https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/):

    git clone https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs

These notebooks only work with `keras and tensorflow`
Please follow the [installation\_instructions.md](
https://github.com/rth/dl-lectures-labs/blob/M2-IMDS/installation_instructions.md)
to get started.
